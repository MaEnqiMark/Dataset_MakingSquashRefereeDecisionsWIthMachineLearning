# Dataset_MakingSquashRefereeDecisionsWIthMachineLearning
This repository provides the collected dataset for the study "Making Referee Decisions with Machine Learning in the Sport of Squash" by Enqi M
- Three Things are included in this study
    - The excel spreadsheet with all the Referee Decisions collected
    - Pictures of the Referee Decisions collected
    - Picture of the Labeling of the Referee Decisions on Digitizeit

- The numberic labeling of the datas are related to each other.
    - The first data collected is labeled "2" because in the spread sheet, the data starts on the second line.
    - The Decision on Line #36 in the spreadsheet, for example, correlates with the data labeled "36" in other folders.

- Decision #2 doesn't have a labeling in Digitizeit because I forgot.
